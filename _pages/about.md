Greetings! 

My name is Maksym Del. 

I am a Ph.D. student and Junior Research Fellow at the University of Tartu's [NLP group](http://tartunlp.ai) (Estonia). 

I also hold a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Tartu (Estonia) and a bachelor's in Software Engineering from Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (Ukraine).

My research interests intersect Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and related AI disciplines.
