Greetings! 

My name is Maksym Del. 

I am a Deep Learning Ph.D. student and Junior Research Fellow at the University of Tartu's [NLP group](http://tartunlp.ai). 

I also hold a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Tartu and a bachelor's in Software Engineering from Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.

On the practical side, I am involved in the [Bergamot](https://browser.mt/) project and contributed to [Neurotolge](https://neurotolge.ee/).

I think about AI specifically and its intersections with other disciplines.
