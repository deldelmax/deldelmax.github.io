Greetings! 

My name is Maksym Del. 

I am a last-year Ph.D. student University of Tartu's NLP group (Estonia; supervised by Mark Fishel), and a Junior ~~Hip Hop Artist~~ Research Scientist at [TartuNLP](http://tartunlp.ai). 

Before that, I got a master's with a focus in Machine Learning from the University of Tartu (Estonia) and a bachelor's in Software Engineering from Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (Ukraine).
