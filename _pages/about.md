Greetings! 

My name is Maksym Del. 

I am a last-year Ph.D. student and Junior Research Scientist at the University of Tartu's [NLP group](http://tartunlp.ai) (Estonia). 

Before that, I got a master's with a focus in Machine Learning from the University of Tartu (Estonia) and a bachelor's in Software Engineering from Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (Ukraine).


My research interests include Machine Reasoning and Argumentation, Dialogue Agents, Large LMs, and RL for NLP.
