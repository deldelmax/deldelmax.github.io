Greetings! 

My name is Maksym Del. 

I am a last year Ph.D. student and Junior Research Fellow at the University of Tartu's [NLP group](http://tartunlp.ai). 

I also hold a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Tartu and a bachelor's in Software Engineering from Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.

My research interests intersect Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and related AI disciplines.
